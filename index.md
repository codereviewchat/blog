<h1>Let's Chat About Code Reviews!</h1>
<br />
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the codereview.chat blog, where we chat and discuss how to do good code reviews. I'll be sharing my lessons learned from the last decade of reviewing code on teams of various sizes.

If you are interested in improving your code reviews please sign up to the mailing list below and if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out at <a href="mailto:hi@codereview.chat">hi@codereview.chat</a>.

**The first post will be shared in the next week or two.**
