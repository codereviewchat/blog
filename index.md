<h1>Let's Chat About Code Reviews!</h1>
<br />
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the codereview.chat blog, a blog focused on improving how you review code.

I'll be sharing the lessons I've learned in the last decade of reviewing code with the hope that I'll spare you the time and money of learning these lessons the hard way ðŸ˜…

If you think this sounds like a good idea please show your support by signing up to the mailing list below. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out at <a href="mailto:hi@codereview.chat">hi@codereview.chat</a>.

**The first post will be shared in the next week or two.** ðŸ¤ž
